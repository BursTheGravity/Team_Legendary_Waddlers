I basically implemented our test function.
If we want, we can change it to System.currentTimeMillis(), 
but I found that for an array of 1 and 10 they were basically 0,
so I decided to use System.nanoTime().

Also, add our algorithms/data/analysis and stuff in the big
comment box on the top and the small one on the bottom pls!

Can delete this file whenever you guys finish. Ty team !!
